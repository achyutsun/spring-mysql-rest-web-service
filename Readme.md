#A Spring and MySQL Powered REST API
This is the very beginning of a project that will be a REST API powered by Java, Spring MVC, and MySQL. The goal is to allow users to type in a URL with a page number, and get back a raw JSON object containing the data for the corresponding page my interactive comic This Is Not a Test. The page data will have originated from a relational database on the server, then been retrieved by Spring, and finally sent to the requesting client as a JSON object.
 
#Example
The project currently isn't up and running. You'll have to download and run it manually.

#Progress: 15%
This is the very beginning of a new project. I've got the Spring project started and a PageRESTController class that takes clients requests, creates a Page object, sets the page number based on the query parameters, and sends that object to the client.  

#Things I'm Loving About Spring
* The Spring Tool Suite is built on Eclipse, so all the things I enjoyed about building my java book-lending application apply
* So far, routing and building a simple web server has been really easy! Next step: connect to a MySQL database.
